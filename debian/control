Description: Qualitative data analysis.
 A qualitative data analysis application.
 QualCoder projects are stored in a Sqlite database. Text files can be typed in
 manually or loaded from txt, odt, docx and optionally ,and not ideally, pdf
 files. Codes can be assigned to text, images and audio/video segments. Codes
 can be grouped into categories. Various types of reports can be produced
 including visual coding graphs, coder comparisons and coding frequencies.
