about = '<h1 class="western">About QualCoder</h1>\
<h2 class="western">Version:</h2>\
<p>QualCoderVersion</p>\
<p>Optional: Install VLC for audio and video coding.<br /> \
Optional: Install ffmpeg for speech to text and waveform images.</p>\
<p>Tested on: Ubuntu 22.04, Windows 10/11, used on macOS and on other Linux distros.</p>\
<p></p>\
<h2 class="western">Acknowledgements</h2>\
<p>Ronggui Huang and Zhang Gehao for creating RQDA, which inspired this software. \
Mike MacCana for the source code for the docx module. \
User: bit4 on stackoverflow who presented the source code to convert html to text. \
ebooklib: Aleksandar ErkaloviÄ‡ https://github.com/aerkalov. \
The VideoLAN team for the bindings to VLC. https://github.com/oaubert/python-vlc. \
The ffmpeg team. https://ffmpeg.org/ used with speech to text and waveform/spectrograph images. \
Julius Reich for creating the cool QualCoder logo. \
 To various members on github for supporting this project.</p>\
<h2 class="western">Other details</h2\
<p>The qda data folder contains folders for imported documents, \
images, audio and video. It also contains the sqlite database, named data.qda, which stores the coding data.</p>\
<p>QualCoder creates a .qualcoder folder inside your home directory. \
This contains QualCoder.log, config.ini (for settings) and \
recent_project.txt. The config file contains the name of the current coder, \
default working directory, selected font and other parameters.</p>\
<p>QualCoder is written in python3 using Qt6 for the graphical interface.</p>\
<p>The REFI-QDA Project import and export seem to work ok, but are still experimental. </p>\
