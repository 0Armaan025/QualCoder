Absolutely! Here's a revised version of the code of conduct with the suggested changes for improved clarity:

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to create an open and inclusive environment where participation in our project and community is a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Behaviors that contribute to a positive environment include:

* Using inclusive and welcoming language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what benefits the community
* Demonstrating empathy towards fellow community members

Unacceptable behavior by participants includes:

* Usage of sexualized language or imagery, unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Revealing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Any conduct that could reasonably be deemed inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and taking appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in both project and public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project include using an official project email, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project representation may be further defined and clarified by maintainers.

## Enforcement

Incidents of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at hi@taguette.org. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, responding in an appropriate manner. The team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be detailed separately.

Maintainers not adhering to or enforcing the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version].
